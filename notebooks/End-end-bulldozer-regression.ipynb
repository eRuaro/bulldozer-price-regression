    "# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozer have been solved for?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Blubook for Bulldozers competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into three parts which could be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "    Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "    Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key fields are in train.csv are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SalesID: the uniue identifier of the sale\n",
    "    MachineID: the unique identifier of a machine.  A machine can be sold multiple times\n",
    "    saleprice: what the machine sold for at auction (only provided in train.csv)\n",
    "    saledate: the date of the sale\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and prediction auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Seen in Data Dictionary in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data). "
